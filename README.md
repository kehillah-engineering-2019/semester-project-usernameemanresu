Zach Newman and Isaac Heintz are build a really cool blimp. The blimp is going to be: cool, epic. 
We are using a large helium balloon as the upward propulsion power. The blimp is enclosed in a frame of balsa wood,
with the electonics attached to the bottom frame. We are using motors to allow the blimp to move forwards, turn, and ascend and descend.
Right now, the top frame has gone through multiple drafts and a finished version is completed. We are using the motors
and control board from a remote control toy drone. Currently, we are working on extending the wires that the motors
are attached to in order to allow to put them on the correct place on the frame. Pictures of our current progress are attached below.
